`[15.10]` total

### How can you use this `30s`

- Use existing hosted map to explore your own data
  - Drag and drop files `10s`
  - Zero config open data portals `10s`
- Host your own - curated map `10s`
  - Allows connections to more complicated data sources

`[15.40]` total

### Zero config `~2m`

Open data portals

- WMS
- CKAN
- SDMX
- OpenDataSoft
- Socrata?

Drag and drop

- vector
- tabular

### Terria catalog JSON `~2m`

- JSON file structure
- Highly customisable
- Much much more functionality than presented to the user (eg Edit style)
- Still don’t need to host your own map!

Take it further

- Extend Terria with plugins
- Develop your own connections!

### Future `~1`

- User workflow to
- Search by location
- More advanced visualisation
  - 3D symbology
- Community engagement - submit styling
- 3D open data?
- Server-side tools for validation
  - Status check
  - Is data able to be visualised?
  - proper search
  - Caching/proxy

#### Future discovery
